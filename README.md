# Code-Quiz
This assignment involved creating a timed quiz with multiple answers to choose from once the user selects to start. If the incorrect answer is selected, the user loses 10 seconds of time (starting from 75sec). Once the time reaches zero or the user answers all of the questions, the quiz ends and tells the user how many questions they got correct, along with a percentage. The user is prompted to input their initials and then lead to the Highscores page where their score and initials are listed. Results will continue to build up here until the user selects to clear it.
